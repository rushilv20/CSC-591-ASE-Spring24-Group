#### OBSERVATIONS :
For the soybean dataset, it is found that the accuracy ranges from 74% to 85% for various values of k,m between 0 and 3. With the exception of m=0, the accuracy is greatest at m=1 and diminishes as m increases. For m=1, several values of k result in the same accuracy.

#### CONCLUSION :
We recommend **m=1** and **k = 0,1,2 or 3** because it gives the best accuracy.
